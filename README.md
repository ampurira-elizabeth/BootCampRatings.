# BootCampRatings.


The project gives ratings on the EPIC values alignment of Bootcamp candidates during Bootcamp. that includes Users in 3 roles. Bootcampers(students), LFAs(Learning Facilitator Assistants), and LFs(Learning Facilitators). Where;

Bootcampers are scored daily on all our EPIC values based on their outputs and observed interactions with their teams. The scores range between -2 to 2 i.e (Very Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied and Very Satisfied)

LFs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates in Bootcamp. They, however, can’t change any of the scores and neither can they add scores.

LFAs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates that are assigned to them during Bootcamp, add scores for them and edit only their candidate’s scores.

Tested my code in  models to ensure the functionality of my system.
